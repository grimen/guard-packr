  # == IMPORTANT:
  #
  #   - Ensure that you don't write rules that owerwrite your source files!
  #     To avoid that either use custom "extension" (see above), or temporarily
  #     generated files as source (e.g. app/assets/javascripts => tmp/javascripts).
  #
  #   - This guard should be placed after any javascript processing (guard-sprockets, guard-jammit, etc.)
  #     within your Guardfile - naturally (Packr makes no sense for pre-processing javascript).

  # watch('tmp/javascripts/.*\.js')
